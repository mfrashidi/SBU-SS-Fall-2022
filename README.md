# Signals and Systems Final Project - Fall 2022

## üß† Overview

This repository contains the implementation of my final project for the Signals and Systems course. The project is divided into two primary components:

1. **Audio Signal Processing**
   - Analysis and filtering of audio signals using spectrograms and Fourier Transform.
   - Implementation of high-pass and low-pass filters.
   - Visualization of filtered signals and their spectrograms.

2. **Image Processing**
   - Development of a custom 2D convolution function for applying convolutional filters to images.
   - Simulation of a two-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with given filters.
   - Visualization of intermediate outputs (feature maps) and analysis of results.

This repository includes all necessary code, outputs, and documentation to understand and reproduce the results.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `audio_processing/`: Contains MATLAB scripts and results for audio signal processing.
- `image_processing/`: Contains MATLAB scripts and results for image processing tasks.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB R2020a** or newer (recommended for compatibility with advanced plotting functions).
- No external libraries are required, adhering to the project's constraints.

Explore the subdirectories for detailed explanations, MATLAB scripts, and results of each component.
